# artifact

**Still learning clojure**. This is a collection of code related to Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Algorithms. Most of the code here is taken from or inspired by tutorials; credit and references are given at the top of each file.

## Usage

NO USAGE Planned... this is for reference and learning.
